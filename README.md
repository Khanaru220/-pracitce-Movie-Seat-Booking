## What I've tried this time?

 - localStorage:
	 - save with .getItem
	 - recall back into inital value when F5
- animation, keyframe:
	- use and manage multile controls in 1 element with comma `,`
- setTimeout() + animation delay:
	- to create "wait" and "smooth" switch 
	- 
## It's still hard to process in mind :
   - What and where variables which used for recall from localStorage. 
	- How we use those variables to update our data when F5
	---> *not control the save, recall ; update technique*
